        <h3> Early Concepts</h6>
        <p> Early flight concepts date back to ancient Greece, with ideas like the myth of Icarus. In the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci designed flying machines inspired by birds.</p>
        <h3>First Controlled Flights</h6>
        <p>The Montgolfier brothers launched the first manned hot-air balloon in 1783. In 1853, Sir George Cayley built a glider, establishing principles of aerodynamics like lift and drag.</p>
        <h3>The Wright Brothers (1903)</h6>
        <p>Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first controlled, powered flight on December 17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with their plane, the Wright Flyer. This event is widely regarded as the birth of modern aviation.</p>
        <h3>World Wars and Advances</h6>
        <p>Both World Wars spurred rapid advancements in aircraft technology, leading to faster, more durable planes and the development of jets by the end of World War II.</p>
        <h3>Commercial Aviation (1950s Onward)</h6>
        <p> The introduction of commercial jet airliners like the Boeing 707 in the 1950s made air travel widely accessible. By the 1970s, iconic planes like the Boeing 747 transformed global connectivity.</p>
        <h3>Modern and Future Aviation</h6>
        <p>Today, aviation focuses on efficiency, sustainability, and innovation, with electric and autonomous aircraft, and even space tourism, on the horizon.</p>
